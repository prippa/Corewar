1. Finish with:
    - live;
    - fork;
    - aff;
    - zjmp;

2. Init all registers to 0 whole process creation

3. Think over:
    - erase the processes on a specific event (cycle_to_die);
    - func that returns the waiting for the functions;
    - commands validation;
    - dump (view the map on the stop);
    - N player number;
    - Nbr cycle;
    - perror exit;
    - Move the PC for all processes simultaneously
    - Color changes commands;
    - Circle the PC for all of the processes;
    - Cycles to wait (intermidiary iterator);
    - color print func (add according to the process parent) [5 - 8];
    - how to slow down the execution in the terminal;
